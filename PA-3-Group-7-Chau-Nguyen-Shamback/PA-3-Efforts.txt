# How to run the program?
Extract the contents of the PA-3-Group-7-Chau-Nguyen-Shamback.zip folder. Click the "PA-3-Executable.exe" link, which will take you to its Replit page. Fork the project and click the green "run" button at the top center of the page. You'll get a console UI that will let you choose specific numbers and dynamic vs. recursive algorithms. In the file explorer on the left, there is a file called Fibonacci_Time.csv, which populates with data every time you run the program.
